# Want the convenience of JQuery's 1 line element creator, but hate dollar signs and CDNs?!

This basic element creator allows you to create elements with a class without the need of external tools.

Import the class into your javascript module, and create elements to your hearts content!

You can declare elements and append them to elements with an ID reference, and continue to use javascripts built in element manipulation functionality

# Instructions

new Element(String: elementType, String: id (default is null), String: class (default is null))

## Methods of new Element

append(String: id)

**WARNING** 
DO NOT TRY TO APPEND AND ELEMENT TO ITSELF! (WIP)

# Future

Its still a work in progress, so its a simple tool that allows you to save a bit of time 
Development will continue to take into account unique attributes of form elements, images etc.
